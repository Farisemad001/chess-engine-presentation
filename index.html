  <h1>Problem Summary</h1>
  <p>
    Building a chess engine requires precise rule enforcement,
    efficient state management, and reliable coordination between
    game logic and user interaction. The complexity of chess arises
    from diverse piece movements, special rules such as castling
    and en passant, and the continuous evaluation of game states
    including check, checkmate, stalemate, and draw conditions.
    Managing these requirements in a structured and efficient
    manner presents a significant design challenge.<br><br>

    This project addresses these challenges by developing a
    data-structure-based chess engine and linking it to a
    graphical user interface. The primary objective is to
    demonstrate how fundamental data structures can be applied
    to model a complex, rule-driven system while supporting
    real-time interaction through a GUI.
  </p>

  <h1>Methodology</h1>
  <p>
    The chess engine is implemented in C++ using a modular
    architecture that separates game logic from presentation.
    The chessboard is represented as an 8×8 array of structured
    objects, where each object stores information about piece
    type, color, and movement state. Legal moves are generated
    dynamically and validated according to official chess rules
    before execution. Special rules such as castling, en passant,
    and pawn promotion are explicitly handled within the engine
    logic.<br><br>

    To support advanced functionality, a doubly linked list is
    used to store move history. Stack-based structures enable
    undo and redo operations, while a hash-based mapping tracks
    board configurations for repetition detection.

  <p>
    The images above show the actual graphical user interface used
    to interact with the chess engine. The interface allows users
    to input moves, monitor engine status, view legal moves, and
    visualize the chessboard in real time. This visual layer
    enhances usability while remaining logically separated from
    the core engine.

  <h1>Achievements & Gained Skills</h1>
  <p>
    This project provided hands-on experience in applying data
    structures to a real, interactive software system. The team
    strengthened its understanding of arrays, linked lists,
    stacks, and hash maps through their integration into a
    complete chess engine. Additional skills were developed in
    object-oriented programming, state management, and rule-
    based algorithm implementation.<br><br>

    The project also enhanced experience in cross-language
    integration by connecting a C++ backend with a Python-based
    graphical interface using inter-process communication.

  <h1>Discussion & Conclusion</h1>
  <p>
    This project demonstrates that complex, rule-based systems
    such as chess can be effectively modeled using fundamental
    data structures. By separating game logic from the graphical
    interface, the system achieves clarity, maintainability, and
    scalability. The modular design allows the engine to remain
    independent while supporting different user interfaces.
  </p>

  <h1>Future Work & Suggestions</h1>
  <p>
    Future development includes enhancing the graphical interface
    and expanding platform support. One planned improvement is
    replacing or complementing the Streamlit interface with a
    web-based frontend using React. Additional future work
    includes integrating AI techniques such as Minimax,
    optimizing performance, and adding game analysis features.
