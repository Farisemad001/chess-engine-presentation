    <h2>Problem Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Building a chess engine requires accurate rule enforcement, efficient state
      management, and reliable communication between the game logic and user interaction.
      The complexity of chess arises from diverse piece movements, special rules such as
      castling and en passant, and the continuous evaluation of game states including
      check, checkmate, and draw conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, integrating a low-level engine with a modern graphical interface
      introduces further design challenges related to synchronization, responsiveness,
      and data exchange between components.

    <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      This project addresses these challenges by developing a chess engine based on
      fundamental data structures and linking it to a graphical user interface.
      The goal is not to build an advanced AI system, but rather to demonstrate how
      core data structure concepts can be applied to model a complex, rule-driven system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project serves as a practical application of the concepts taught in the
      ECE251 Data Structures course, bridging the gap between theory and real-world
      software design.

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>
      The chess engine is implemented in C++ using a modular architecture that separates
      core game logic from presentation. The chessboard is represented as an 8×8 array
      of structured objects, where each object stores the piece type, color, and movement
      state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Legal moves are generated dynamically and validated according to chess rules before
      execution. Special rules such as castling, en passant, and pawn promotion are
      explicitly handled within the engine logic.

    <h2>Data Structures & Integration</h2>
    <p>
      A doubly linked list is used to maintain move history, while stack-based structures
      support undo and redo operations through game state snapshots. A hash-based mapping
      tracks board positions to enable repetition detection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engine is connected to a graphical user interface built using Python and
      Streamlit. Communication is achieved through a subprocess-based command protocol,
      allowing the C++ engine to function as a backend logic module while Streamlit
      manages visualization and user interaction.

    <h2>Achievements & Gained Skills</h2>
    <p>
      This project provided hands-on experience in applying data structures within a
      complete, interactive software system. The team strengthened its understanding of
      arrays, linked lists, stacks, and hash maps through their coordinated use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additional skills were gained in object-oriented design, rule-based algorithm
      implementation, state management, and cross-language integration between C++
      and Python.

    <h2>Discussion & Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The project demonstrates that complex, rule-based systems such as chess can be
      effectively modeled using fundamental data structures. Separating game logic from
      the graphical interface improves clarity, maintainability, and extensibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, the project illustrates how theoretical concepts can be transformed into
      a functional, interactive application suitable for real-world software engineering.

    <h2>Future Work</h2>
    <p>
      Future development includes enhancing the graphical interface and expanding
      platform support. One planned improvement is replacing or complementing the
      Streamlit interface with a web-based frontend using React.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additional future work includes integrating AI techniques such as Minimax,
      optimizing performance, and adding game analysis and replay features.
